PCM Real Audio Streamer + Client is a set of 2 windows applications that stream 
CD quality audio (44100 khz, 16 bit,2 channels) over the network and 
perform playback at the same time (client).

Streamer streams the file over tcp/ip using only UTP/RTP protocol to the client
PC that runs the client application. Streamer uses an adaptive algorithm, which is 
based on the real playout time of each packet that leaves the server, in order to
stream the file to the client station.

Client application assembles the packets received into blocks which are subsequently 
pushed onto the sound card for playout. Client uses a classic cyclic buffer for 
buffering and playout. 

Currently these two applications work only on windows systems. 

Streamer was highly influenced to a great extent by this great work of
Nicholas J Humfrey's work: http://www.aelius.com/njh/pcm6cast/old/

Client was also based on David Overton's great article about playing audio on 
windows using waveout function calls :
